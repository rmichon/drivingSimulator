This very simple program retrieves the UDP messages from the car simulator, format them into OSC messages and send them to a defined port.

Type "make" to compile.
Type "make clean" to clean.

To change the input or output ports, the destination IP, the buffer size or the root of the OSC addresses, just change the corresponding global variables at the beginning of udp2osc.cpp (I know, this is not very practicle but it does job, plus those will probably never have to be changed...).
Don't forget to recompile after you made those modifications.
